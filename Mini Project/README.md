# Mini Project

The quadrant location of an ArUco marker controls the position of motor controlled wheel. A PID loop is used to get accurate positioning of the wheel. I2C communication enable the PI to talk the Arduino. To develop our PID models we used Matlab to simulate a various set of respeones. 
All of our Code is within the Code Folder. The arduino folder contains both code to make the mini project to work as well as for the Matalb response code to work. 
The documentation folder included Word/PDF documents that explain how both our Arduino PID code works and how our Python code works.
