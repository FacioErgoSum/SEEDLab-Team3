## Mini Project
Motor poistion controlled using the relative location of an ArUco marker. A PID loop is used to control motor position, while openCV detect the markers. I2C sends data from a Raspberry Pi to an Arduino. The arduino can also talk to Matlab to simulate repsonses and control algorithims. This folder contains more information about the project.
